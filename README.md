## Details
**Project Title:** Controversial Voting Process for the GRAMMYs Awards Digital Humanities Project 

**Description:** Due to the lack of transparency regarding the criteria of how winners and nominees are chosen, there has been controversy on the undemocratic voting system involving the anonymous review committee at the GRAMMYs, which is an issue that has also been raised by the former CEO of the GRAMMYs, Deborah Dugan. Hence my group project aims to use the Spotify API to study the songs nominated at GRAMMY using parallel coordinates visualization.

Read the poster or final report for more information. Also do check out the python notebook.

**Requirements:**
1. Spotify API Token (Note own API key not YET removed)
2. Python
3. Spotipy
